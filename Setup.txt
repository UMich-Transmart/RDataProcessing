Assumptions in the following setup steps:
1. this archive is cloned in the same directory as RInterface (see: https://github.com/UMich-Transmart/RInterface)
2. the set described in the Rinterface README.md has been successfully completed.

Setting up to use these test (in R)

make sure that you have loaded the following packages:
transmartRClient (see below and the notes in ../RInterface/bin/installCommands.R)
ggplot2 (standard R library)

install.packages(pkgs=c("RCurl", "RJSONIO", "RProtoBuf", "plyr", "hash", "reshape"))
base <- "../RInterface" # or where ever you have it 
install.packages(base, repos = NULL, type = "source")
